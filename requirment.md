Hi Long,

Thank you again for your continued interest in our Frontend Developer III position with us. After your interview yesterday, we'd like to move you forward to the next steps of the process. Below are instructions for the technical interview:

Frontend Exercise: Brewery Finder

Build a small app that searches breweries from the OpenBreweryDB API (https://www.openbrewerydb.org). Vue 3 is preferred, but you may use any framework. The goal is not feature-completeness but to show how you break UI into components and manage state, how you approach testing, and your sense of design/UX.

Timebox: 1-2 hours.

Include a short README on how to run, what choices you made, and what you would improve with more time.

Requirements

- Search by text, filter by city and type, paginate results.
- List view shows name, city, state, type.
- Click a result to see details (modal or side panel).
- Handle loading, error, and empty states.
- URL should reflect search/filters/page.

Technical Notes

- Vue 3 preferred (starting template available for optional use), but any framework allowed.
- State management optional (Pinia or equivalent if you choose).
- Styling approach is up to you, keep it clean and usable.
- Add one meaningful test (e.g.for a list item component).

What We'll Look At

- Component design and organization.
- Choices around state (if any).
- Example of testing approach.
- Usability, accessibility, and visual clarity.
